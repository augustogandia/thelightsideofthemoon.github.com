  <h1>In memoriam of Paul Nicolas Ferrari</h1>
  <p>(November 2025 - Mendoza, Argentina)</p>
  <img src="Nicolas Ferrari.png" alt="" width="200">
  <p>As in the first ascent to Mont Blanc, the contribution of the initiator was overshadowed by the "opaque framework" in which it was embedded, quoting Paul Nicolas. 
     Examples of this include: experiencing a 'no-offer' to teach design studio, information hidden in the semester course offer at the start of the program, 
     the assignment through timing with another project, indirect communication, and preferential tasks (site hidden forces) of the main project to a postdoc arriving a year after me, 
     the constant reminder to not discuss publication-related work, but to focus on the project, 
     to be wrongly steered or left without concrete feedback after raising all these concerns above in the hierarchy, 
     thinking that MIT Architecture was an open and horizontal community?.
     only to find later that my draft was online without my name, to be neglected at several presentations, including the Architecture Biennale one. 
     <br>
     Together with multiple self-driven and financed initiatives (e.g., presenting at ACADIA and the research slam, coorganizing workshops,
     participating through the submission of a miniature of an extreme habitat at the Architecture Biennale, learning and applying Architecture Theory and Philosophy), 
     these collaborative projects aim to restore the contributions 
     through an underlizing diagram that redirects hydrocarbons into a novel, environmentally benign carbon ontology for extreme habitats.

              Attempting  to  locate  the  essence  of  photography,  at  least  in  contradistinction to painting, 
              Barthes concludes that in looking at a photograph, one has certainty that is looking at an image of something 
              that once existed, that once was (a model that cannot be dismissed as a construct of the imagination). 
              And for Barthes, this lends to photography a particular and inescapable melancholy, since from the outset, and always,
              linked with the notion of time, and hence ineluctably with death; a melancholy made all the more poignant by
              the vulnerability of photographs themselves to ageing. What one must remark here, though, about these photographs 
              or photomontages, is that they undermine the certainty that the scene presented has in any way ever existed: 
              the photomontage here leaves one incapable of reconstituting its ‘reality’, such that one is left only with the unease of a reality,
              which is reconstituted, an original which is already a reproduction. One struggles between certainty and uncertainty, 
              the images continually antagonize their own status, standing contradictions as not simply representations of some prior
              ‘reality’, nor just presentations – ‘what they are’ – but more complex constructs,  
              de-presentations perhaps – 
              a form of re-creative play of perception, disrupting representational logic. And the creative process itself, 
              haunted by Freud’s notion of an ‘unconscious writing’ – loose assemblages of pre-existing fabric unleashing bizarre new hybrids – 
              carries with it all the disruptive potential of an originary memory.

      <h2> Allegory/repetition (MIT, 2018) </h2>
          
            <br>

              There is, indeed, an almost absurd level of repetition taking place here, 
              not only in the background splicing of the scene itself, but also of the various fragments inserted into it, 
              sometimes of differing scales or from different angles, and which create an impression of infinite regress, 
              or of an apparently unending metonymic series. The gesture (of repetition) is gratuitous and deliberate enough 
              to arrest one’s attention, and plays out the dilemma of the Modernist arts that must endlessly refer back to a disenchanted 
              (representational) past, even as they seek to escape it: a Sisyphean endeavour. But in so doing, the  images  exhibit  a
              self-awareness  (by  virtue  of  their  very  gratuity),  which  finds parallel in Foucault’s description of the 
              painting representation by René Magritte, and whose strategies work to a similar effect: an exact representation 
              of a ball game, seen from a terrace fenced by a low wall. On the left, the wall is topped by a balustrade, 
              and in the junction thus formed, may be seen the same scene, but on a smaller scale (about one-half). 
              Must we suppose, unfolding, a series of smaller and smaller other ‘representations’, always identical? Perhaps. 
              But that is unnecessary. In the same painting, two images are bound thus laterally by a relation of similitude, 
              enough for exterior reference to a model, through resemblance, to be disturbed, rendered floating and uncertain.
              What 'represents' what?. Such strategic repetition disrupts the representational project by assuring a proliferation
              of  textual  possibilities,  continually undermining any stasis of meaning.  
              As  such,  and  at  the  very  site  of  the  symbolic  (its  historic  image-horde), it provokes an allegorical reading.
              Allegory occurs whenever one text is doubled by another, whenever one text is read through another, however 
              fragmentary, intermittent, or chaotic their relationship might be. The paradigm for the allegorical work is thus the palimpsest
              or ruin, incomplete or fragmentary sites which proffer and defer a promise of meaning. And such is the case here: the images ruptured 
              or incomplete, ruins or runes which must be deciphered, but deciphered according to an allegorical mode of thought which will never settle, 
              which ruptures symbolic singularity...

      <h2> The Punctum (MIT, 2018) </h2>
          
            <br>

               The images presented to me were photographs, ostensibly so at least, for they were veiled behind a protective sheet 
               of translucent paper that rendered them feint and misty, making it difficult to discern anything but distant and undemarcated landscapes, 
               expansive and harsh to the horizon. Intrigue was added in that they were proffered under the rubric of ‘architecture’, 
               seemingly doubly displaced in this context. In lifting the protective cellulose sheet, the images were revealed ‘naked’, 
               but they in no way resolved themselves. Photo-graphs they certainly were, predominantly landscapes, sometimes structures,
               and  with  buildings,  or  fragments  of  buildings,  included  within  their  frame  (sometimes spilling out of it). 
               But such fragments, despite their elegant and beguiling composition, slyly subverted their own status, revealing themselves as 
               ‘impossible’  combinations,  contradictory  scales  and  styles  juxtaposed  in  anomalous landscapes. Such undecidability of 
               classification compelled further scrutiny, which in turn led to further subversion of the scene presented, 
               such that one experienced a curious and vertiginous feeling of unease, which contradicted the aesthetic poise and calm of the imagery.
               In his mournful book Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes suggests that for a photograph to arrest the eye, it must in some way wound; 
               there must be a punctum (a sting, a cut, a hole), an accident that pricks me, that is poignant to me. 
               Such wounding, he contrasts to the general intellectual or cultural interest that a photograph may have, the context in which it is placed,
               the studium, a plane of consciousness that the punctum violently penetrates (perhaps here a multiple stab-wound).
               What shocked me most here (and in the initial coup d’œil) was that it was the photographs themselves that were here wounded,
               whose surfaces were cut and inscribed, as wax-slabs of consciousness lacerated with deliberate menace. 
               A technique of photomontage, doubtless, but one which did not  simply  paste  images  one  on  top  of  the  other,  
               but  buried  them  alongside one another, embedded them into each other, such that the implacable photographic surface and its 
               reflective flatness were left  undisturbed  save  for these ritualistic cuts, as if marks on a body. And it was with such painstaking 
               deliberation – I refer to it as menacing through its very deliberation – that the various fragmentary elements were consigned to their
               final resting place within the frame of an expanded landscape. Expanded, since when one looked closely, 
               one realized that such landscapes were themselves montages, the same scene repeated (sometimes reversed) several times, 
               spliced in over-exposed blankness to create these seemingly wide-open, almost agoraphobic landscapes with their sweeping and dizzying horizontality.
               Such  dislocation  of  belief, from my initial acceptance of the scene presented as being a ‘real’ landscape (we all believe in the ‘reality’ of photographs,
               whatever their effect) to the recognition of photographic trickery, and the final, faintly nauseous, realization of the absolute deceit of these images,
               was nonetheless accompanied by an exhilaration (my punctum?) that was not merely the seduction of appearances. 
               For the disruption seemed to carry  much further than these curiously  aesthetic  combinations:  
               it  radiated  outwards, slipping  past  the  delimiting  frame.  ‘Ultimately,’  
               Barthes  adds,  ‘photography is subversive not when it frightens, repels or even stigmatises, but when it is pensive, when it thinks’.
               My realisation was simply this: that these photographs, these collaged pieces of architecture, were pensive, 
               carried a somehow latent threat.

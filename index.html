              Attempting  to  locate  the  essence  of  photography,  at  least  in  contradistinction to painting, 
              Barthes concludes that in looking at a photograph, one has certainty that one is looking at an image of something 
              that once existed, that once was (that cannot be dismissed as a construct of the imagination). 
              And for Barthes, this lends to photography a particular and inescapable melancholy, since from the outset, and always,
              linked with the notion of time, and hence ineluctably with death; a melancholy made all the more poignant by
              the vulnerability of photographs themselves to ageing. What one must remark here, though, about these photographs 
              or photomontages, is that they undermine the certainty that the scene presented has in any way ever existed: 
              the photograph here  leaves  one  incapable  of  reconstituting  its  ‘reality’,  such that one is left only with the unease of a reality,
              which is reconstituted, an original which is already a reproduction. One struggles between certainty and uncertainty, 
              the images continually antagonize their own status, standing contradictions as not simply representations of some prior
              ‘reality’, nor just  presentations  – ‘what  they  are’  –  but  more  complex  constructs,  de-presentations perhaps – 
              a form of re-creative play of perception, disrupting representational logic. And the creative process itself, 
              haunted by Freud’s notion of an ‘unconscious writing’ – loose assemblages of pre-existing fabric unleashing bizarre new hybrids – 
              carries with it all the disruptive potential of an originary memory.

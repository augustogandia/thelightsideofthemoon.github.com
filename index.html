  The investigation addresses the projected doubling of residential buildings globally by 2050. 
  This crisis necessitates the reorientation of the organic legacy from fuel to dynamic shells. 
  The thesis posits that "hanging elasticos"—bridges between our minds and the possibilities of matter—must be instantiated
  in this series of interdisciplinary habitable spaces, inviting the exploration of a novel carbon ontology for reconnecting architecture theory and practice.

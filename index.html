              Attempting  to  locate  the  essence  of  photography,  at  least  in  contradistinction to painting, 
              Barthes concludes that in looking at a photograph, one has certainty that one is looking at an image of something 
              that once existed, that once was (that cannot be dismissed as a construct of the imagination). 
              And for Barthes, this lends to photography a particular and inescapable melancholy, since from the outset, and always,
              linked with the notion of time, and hence ineluctably with death; a melancholy made all the more poignant by
              the vulnerability of photographs themselves to ageing. What one must remark here, though, about these photographs 
              or photomontages, is that they undermine the certainty that the scene presented has in any way ever existed: 
              the photograph here leaves  one  incapable  of  reconstituting  its  ‘reality’,  such that one is left only with the unease of a reality,
              which is reconstituted, an original which is already a reproduction. One struggles between certainty and uncertainty, 
              the images continually antagonize their own status, standing contradictions as not simply representations of some prior
              ‘reality’, nor just  presentations  – ‘what  they  are’  –  but  more  complex  constructs,  de-presentations perhaps – 
              a form of re-creative play of perception, disrupting representational logic. And the creative process itself, 
              haunted by Freud’s notion of an ‘unconscious writing’ – loose assemblages of pre-existing fabric unleashing bizarre new hybrids – 
              carries with it all the disruptive potential of an originary memory.

              There is, indeed, an almost absurd level of repetition taking place here, 
              not only in the background splicing of the scene itself, but also of the various fragments inserted into it, 
              sometimes of differing scales or from different angles, and which create an impression of infinite regress, 
              or of an apparently unending metonymic series. The gesture (of repetition) is gratuitous and deliberate enough 
              to arrest one’s attention, and plays out the dilemma of the Modernist arts that must endlessly refer back to a disenchanted 
              (representational) past, even as they seek to escape it: a Sisyphean endeavour. But in so doing, the  images  exhibit  a
              self-awareness  (by  virtue  of  their  very  gratuity),  which  finds parallel in Foucault’s description of the 
              painting representation by René Magritte, and whose strategies work to a similar effect: an exact representation 
              of a ball game, seen from a terrace fenced by a low wall. On the left, the wall is topped by a balustrade, 
              and in the junction thus formed, may be seen the same scene, but on a smaller scale (about one-half). 
              Must we suppose, unfolding, a series of smaller and smaller other ‘representations’, always identical? Perhaps. 
              But that is unnecessary. In the same painting, two images are bound thus laterally by a relation of similitude, 
              enough for exterior reference to a model, through resemblance, to be disturbed, rendered floating and uncertain.
              What 'represents' what?. Such strategic repetition disrupts the representational project by assuring a proliferation
              of  textual  possibilities,  continually undermining any stasis of meaning.  
              As  such,  and  at  the  very  site  of  the  symbolic  (its  historic  image-horde), it provokes an allegorical reading.
              Allegory occurs whenever one text is doubled by another, whenever one text is read through another, however 
              fragmentary, intermittent or chaotic their relationship might be. The paradigm for the allegorical work is thus the palimpsest
              or ruin, incomplete or fragmentary sites which proffer and defer a promise of meaning. And such is the case here: the images ruptured 
              or incomplete, ruins or runes which must be deciphered, but deciphered according to an allegorical mode of thought which will never settle, 
              which ruptures symbolic singularity...
